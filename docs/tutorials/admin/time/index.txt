Using Time based data in Geonode
==================

This section will help you to configure Geonode in a way that allows you to upload layers that have a time axis. For example weather information.

In order to be able to upload time-based data, you need to change 2 parameters in your local_settings.py

1. First, you need to tell geonode that Geoserver support a protocol called WMST. You do this by changing the WMST_ENABLED flag in the default OGC_SERVER array to True

  OGC_SERVER = {
    'default' : {
      'WMST_ENABLED' : False,
      
You can read more about WMS Time on the Geoserver website: http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/services/wms/time.html




2. Secondly, you have to use the more modern, but slightly less tested uploader called geoserver.importer and allow this importer be Time enabled. Below the OGC-SERVER array, add the UPLOADER array:

# Uploader Settings
  UPLOADER = {
    'BACKEND' : 'geoserver.importer',
    'OPTIONS' : {
        'TIME_ENABLED': True,
        'GEOGIT_ENABLED': False,
    }
  }

See: https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/blob/master/geonode/settings.py#L427


You are now ready to upload data. But first we need to prepare the data itself.

Data can have a start and an end column, if the data is periodic. The effect in geonode of this data is XXX

If data only has a start-date, the effect will be xxxx


The data format is explained in code here: 
https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/blob/master/geonode/upload/templates/upload/layer_upload_time.html#L185

The geoserver time page also has info about the date format of your columns.
